Perfetto. Vado dritto al punto e ti preparo **una descrizione pronta stile GitHub “About / README”**, coerente con l’esempio di NinjaSketch ma adattata a un **Todo List project serio da dev**, non da tutorialino.

Puoi **copiarla e incollarla così com’è** e, se vuoi, dopo la rifiniamo ancora più “portfolio-killer”.

## 📝 TodoList

A clean and functional Todo List application built to practice real-world frontend development patterns.
The project focuses on **state management, user interactions, and code structure**, rather than flashy UI.
It was developed as a learning project to strengthen logic, component design, and maintainable architecture.

The app allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently with a simple, intuitive workflow.

## 🦄 Features

Here’s what you can do with **TodoList**:

* **Add Tasks**
  Quickly create new tasks with a minimal input flow.

* **Mark as Completed**
  Toggle tasks between completed and active states.

* **Delete Tasks**
  Remove tasks cleanly without breaking the state.

* **Persistent State**
  Tasks remain consistent during user interaction and updates.

* **Clean UI & UX**
  Focused on clarity and usability, without unnecessary distractions.

## 🎯 Keyboard & Interaction Flow

* Fast task creation with input focus handling
* Immediate visual feedback on task completion
* Smooth state updates without page reloads

---

## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

I started by defining a clear data structure for tasks and how they should behave across the application.
From there, I focused on building reusable React components with predictable state updates.

Special attention was given to:

* Managing task state correctly
* Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
* Keeping the logic separated from the UI
* Writing readable and maintainable code

Once the core features were stable, I added **testing** to validate user interactions such as adding, completing, and deleting tasks.

This project wasn’t about visuals — it was about **thinking like a developer**, not just making something that “works”.

## 📚 What I Learned

### 🧠 State Management

* Learned how to properly structure and update state in React
* Improved understanding of immutable updates

### 🧩 Component Design

* Breaking features into reusable and readable components
* Keeping responsibilities clear and separated

### 🧪 Testing Mindset

* Writing tests for real user behavior instead of implementation details
* End-to-end testing with Cypress to ensure reliability

### 🧱 Clean Code

* Naming things correctly
* Structuring files logically
* Thinking ahead for scalability

---

## 💭 How Can It Be Improved?

* Add task filtering (All / Active / Completed)
* Add task editing
* Persist tasks using localStorage or backend
* Add drag & drop reordering
* Improve accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
* Add dark mode
